    "This file will perform a webscrape the mathematics, statistics and computer science articles found on [ArXiv.org](arxiv.org) and the mirror site [xxx.lanl.gov](xxx.lanl.gov).  The program will collect the title, aurthors, subjects and id number in groups of 25.  After getting the information for a group of 25 articles, the program will then read the pdf file using the id number and then store the title, aurthors, subjects, id number and paper in a Mongo database.  For each group of 25 articles, the site will switch between ArXiv and its mirror site to avoid being detected as a bot.\n",
